# Snake Game

This project will be developed by Georgi Terziev and Antonio Georgiev as part of the JS-Advanced course at FMI, Sofia University.
The project represents the classic snake game with two gameplay options:

## ðŸŽ® Game Modes
### 1. Single Player Mode
- Play solo and grow your snake by collecting food.
- Avoid crashing into walls or your own tail to survive.
- Try to beat your high score!

### 2. Multiplayer Mode
- Challenge a friend in a head-to-head snake match!
- Both players control their snakes on the same board.
- Navigate carefully and avoid collisions with the walls, your tail, and your opponent's snake.
- The last player standing wins!
